Some years ago Yandex.Music had a dedicated section in the sidebar, where you could read a lyrics of selected song. It was not very full, and that is probably why it was removed.

When searching for music i accidentally found a page where this lyrics was still present, so i made an extension that extracts the text from there and puts it where it was previously. Of course, since this database is no longer in use it is no longer updated, so newer or less popular songs don't have lyrics.

I actually do not know JS at all, so code, let's say, not the best.
